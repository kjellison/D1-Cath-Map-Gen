All based on the amazing blog post by Boris the Brave at

It still needs dividing walls, possibly prefab rooms, and minisets.
This could be a great tool for Dungeons & Dragons dungeons.

Have fun with it.
Press:
  'C' to change color scheme.
  'R' to show room numbers on the tiles.
  'S' to save a PNG of the map.
  Right-Click to generate a new map.

I really enjoyed getting to this point without code examples, it has given me a lot to think about.

Planned Changes:
-There is no need for a full grid of pieces, each walkable tile can populate the 4 pieces it needs, nor tiles for that matter.
-comments..... someday... maybe.
-Dividing walls and doors.
  +Route Checking
-Possibly user driven changes i.e. add a room, add a feature, blah blah blah
